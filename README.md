# HasiUtils4J
HasiUtils4J is a custom Java utility library designed for internal use in my personal projects, but anyone is welcome to use it. The library includes various helpful classes and methods to simplify common tasks in Java programming.

If you're interested in contributing to the library, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes. You can also report any issues you encounter using the issue tracker.

Note that while I will do my best to review pull requests and address issues, this is a personal project and I may not always have the time or resources to respond promptly.

This project is **COMPLETELY** free to use. Anyone can make use of this project for any kind of open source use, so long as said use is also under the AGPLv3 license. For more info, consult [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Hasibix/HasiUtils4J/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
